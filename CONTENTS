This is a package to build robots for wikipedia. Some example robots are 
included. 

=======================================================================
PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS PACKAGE. These programs can actually
modify the live wikipedia on the net, and proper wiki-etiquette should
be followed before running it on any of the wikipedia sites.

More precise information, and a list of the options that are available for
the various programs, are given at the start of the programs' source code files.

You need to have at least python version 2.3 installed on your computer
to be able to run any of the code in this package. Support for older
versions of python is not planned.

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
user-config.py in your current directory. It needs at least two lines: 
The first line should set your real name; this will be used to identify you
when the robot is making changes, in case you are not logged in. The
second line sets the code of your home language. The file should look like:

===========
username='My name'
mylang='xx'
===========

There are other variables that can be set in the configuration file, please
check config.py for ideas.

After that, you are advised to create a username + password for the bot, and
run login.py. If this is not done, the bot will make its edits under an IP
number rather than a login name, a practice which is not liked by people
checking Recentchanges.

You do not need to "install" this package to be able to make use of
it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked
it or where you have your copy of the CVS sources.
