This is a package to build robots for wikipedia. Some example robots are 
included. This is a bit nl:-centered, but if something doesn't work for your
language wikipedia, just send a bug report and we'll take a look.

=======================================================================
PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS PACKAGE. These programs can actually
modify the live wikipedia on the net, and proper wiki-etiquette should
be followed before running it on any of the wikipedia sites.
=======================================================================

The contents of the package are:

The library itself
------------------
LICENSE                : a reference to the Python Software Foundation license
wikipedia.py           : The wikipedia library
config.py              : Configuration module containing all defaults
logger.py              : A support library logging screen output to a file
unequal.py             : A few routines coordinating exceptions to the 
                         rule that interwiki-linked pages are equal
titletranslate.py      : rules and tricks to auto-translate wikipage titles

Utilities
---------
extract_names.py       : A program to make a list of 480 pagenames based on a 
                         html file that is the result of a Special:Allpages 
                         request.
parsepopular.py        : Make statistics based on 2 html dumps of most popular
                         pages.
login.py               : Log in to an account on your "home" wikipedia. 

Robots
------
autoredir.py           : Make redirect pages for capitalized months like 
                         [[1 Januari]]; a one-time robot for the nl: Wikipedia 
backref.py             : List all pages for which nl:->xx: does not correspond 
                         to xx:->nl:. This is obsolescent now that treelang has
                         a "-backref" command line parameter.
brackethttp.py         : a bot replacing a ()-bracketed http: link by an
                         explicit [ ] link to avoid a parser problem.
disamb_all.py          : Run the robot solve_disambiguation.py (see below) over
                         articles listed in a file passed as argument.
getlang.py             : Get interwiki links for years AD
interwiki.py           : New robot, currently in testing phase only, that will
                         replace treelang.py and treelang_all.py in due time.
                         This uses a non-linear approach to be less demanding
                         on the wikipedia servers.
test.py                : Misc testing, now configured to test whether you are 
                         logged in.
treelang_all.py        : A script that runs treelang.py for each of the
                         pages in your home wikipedia. 
treelang.py            : Recursive search for interwiki links that are 
                         appropriate to a page. Obsolescent.
yearlayout.py          : An old robot used to change the layout of all nl: year 
                         pages.
solve_disambiguation.py: Disambiguate pages from the command line. 
upload.py              : A new robot that can currently only simply upload
                         an image to wikipedia, but it will in the future
                         be able to insert the image in a wiki page as well.
standardize_interwiki.py:A robot that downloads a page, and reformats the 
                         interwiki links in a standard way (i.e. move all
                         of them to the bottom or the top, with the same
                         separator, in the right order).

More precise information, and a list of the options that are available for
the various programs, are given inside the programs' source code files.

You need to have at least python version 2.3 installed on your computer
to be able to run any of the code in this package. Support for older
versions of python is not planned.

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
user-config.py in your current directory. It needs at least two lines: 
The first line should set your real name; this will be used to identify you
when the robot is making changes, unless you are logged in. The
second line sets the code of your home language. The file should look like:

===========
username='My name'
mylang='xx'
===========

There are other variables that can be set in the configuration file, please
check config.py for ideas.

The robot has been used on en:, da:, fr:, fy: and hu: so far. We're
ironing out bugs showing up on UTF-8 wikipedia's.

You do not need to "install" this package to be able to make use of
it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked
it or where you have your copy of the CVS sources.
