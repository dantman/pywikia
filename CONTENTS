backref-en.py understands various command-line arguments:
    xx: (including the colon) check links to and from xx: instead of English.
    -one : check named page only
    -file : check pages in named file
    -start : check all pages starting from named page

treelang.py understands various command-line arguments:
    -force: do not ask permission to make changes
    -always: make changes even when a single byte is changed in the page,
             not only when one of the links has a significant change.
    -same: try to translate the page to other languages by testing whether
           a page with the same name exists on each of the other known 
           wikipedias
    -hint: used as -hint:de:Anweisung to give the robot a hint where to
           start looking for translations
    -name: similar to -same, but UPPERCASE the last name for eo:
    -untranslated: only run on untranslated pages, and interactively ask
                   for a translation hints on such pages.
    -confirm: ask for confirmation in all cases. Without this argument, 
              additions and unambiguous modifications are made without
              confirmation.
    -autonomous: run automatically, do not ask any questions. If a question
                 to an operator is needed, write the name of the page
                 to autonomous_problems.dat and terminate.

     All other arguments are words that make up the page name.

solve_disambiguation.py:
     Can be used to disambiguate pages from the command line. Specify
     the disambiguation page on the command line. The program will
     pick up the page, and look for all alternative links, and show
     them with a number adjacent to them. It will then automatically
     loop over all pages referring to the disambiguation page, and
     show 30 characters on each side of the reference to help you make
     the decision between the alternatives. It will ask you to type
     the number of the appropriate replacement, and perform the change
     robotically.

All of the programs have "nl:" as their default. It may take a little or 
a lot to make them run on other wikipedias. Be especially careful if your
wikipedia uses UTF-8, as that has not been tested at all.
