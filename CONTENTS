This is a package to build robots for wikipedia. Some example robots are 
included. This is a bit nl:-centered, but if something doesn't work for your
language wikipedia, just send a bug report and we'll take a look.

=======================================================================
PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS PACKAGE. These programs can actually
modify the live wikipedia on the net, and proper wiki-etiquette should
be followed before running it on any of the wikipedia sites.

The contents of the package are:

LICENSE                : a reference to the Python Software Foundation license

                         to xx:->nl:. This is obsolescent now that treelang has
                         a "-backref" command line parameter.
extract_names.py       : A program to make a list of 480 pagenames based on a 
                         html file that is the result of a Special:Allpages 
                         request.

                         pages.
test.py                : Misc testing, now configured to test whether you are 
                         logged in.
treelang_all.py        : A script that runs treelang.py for each of the
                         pages in your home wikipedia. 
treelang.py            : Recursive search for interwiki links that are 
                         appropriate to a page.
wikipedia.py           : The wikipedia library
yearlayout.py          : An old robot used to change the layout of all nl: year 
                         pages.
login.py               : Log in to an account on your "home" wikipedia. 
solve_disambiguation.py: Disambiguate pages from the command line. 

You need at least python version 2.3 installed on your computer to be
able to run any of the code in this package. Support for older
versions of python is not planned.

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
'username.dat' in your current directory. It has two lines: The first
line is your real name; this will be used to identify you when the
robot is making changes, unless you are logged in. The second line is
normally 2 characters: the code of your home wikipedia. If the second
line is missing, your home wikipedia is assumed to be 'test'. It may
take a little or a lot to make the programs run on non-nl:
wikipedias. It has been used on en:, da: and fy: so far.

You do not need to "install" this package to be able to make use of
it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked
it or where you have your copy of the CVS sources.
